Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment

This is a repository for any and all code written for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course through Johns Hopkins University Course Project

(find all project-related materials in the UCI HAR Dataset directory, however, copies of the important files have been put into this main directory to fulfill the submission requirement)

    Unzip the source (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) into a folder on your local drive, say C:/DataScience/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data/data

    Put run_analysis.R into C:/DataScience/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

    In RStudio: setwd("C:/DataScience/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data"), followed by: source("run_analysis.R")

    The generated file can be found in C:/DataScience/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data with subject name as merged_data.txt and data_with_means.txt
